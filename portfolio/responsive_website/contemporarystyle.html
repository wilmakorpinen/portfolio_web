            <h2>Contemporary style</h2>


            <p>The early to mid-twentieth century saw the height of modernism in both art and design. While the world’s perception of art was being challenged, the German Bauhaus and the pioneers of modern Scandinavian design were crafting furniture and architecture that favored simplicity, form, and function. From modern came mid-century modern and the same principles were carried into the ever-popular styles of the 1950’s and 60’s. Modern style today isn’t too far off from its original roots. The objectives are all the same and the clean-lined, uniformity of mid-century modern is still just as favored. Though it came to be around the 1970s, contemporary style doesn’t stem from a movement and it doesn’t refer to a specific period — it’s ever changing. In the beginning, it borrowed ideas from Modernism and blended styles from across the map before coming into its own.</p>

            <h2>Color & Shape & Line</h2>

            <p>Contemporary spaces can have a bold starkness–think monochromatic black and white–but they also can swing all across the color wheel. While modern design favors strong, straight lines, contemporary furniture can get a bit curvier. Contemporary style is a living, breathing entity. “Contemporary Design” then? Well contemporary by definition means “existing, occurring, or living at the same time; belonging to the same time.” And that is exactly the same for the use of the term in interior design. Contemporary design refers to what is popular or used right now. Contemporary design can be very eclectic for that reason, because it is ever changing and borrows pieces and styles from all different eras. It doesn’t have to be something that is “designed” right now – for example; furniture and art from the modern era are often used in contemporary design, and tradition mouldings and millwork are incorporated in many cases.</p>
